## Why You Need a German Bank Account

A local bank account is essential for receiving your salary, paying rent, and managing daily expenses in Germany.

## Types of Banks

- **Traditional Banks:** Sparkasse, Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, etc.
- **Online Banks:** N26, DKB, Comdirect, etc. (often easier for expats)

## Required Documents

- Passport or EU national ID
- Proof of address (Meldebescheinigung)
- Visa or residence permit (for non-EU citizens)
- Sometimes: proof of income or employment

## The Process

1. Choose your bank (compare fees, English support, online vs. branch)
2. Book an appointment or apply online
3. Submit your documents
4. Wait for approval (can be instant with online banks)
5. Receive your bank card by post

## Schufa Credit Check

Most banks check your credit history (Schufa). Online banks like N26 may not require this for basic accounts.

## Tips

- N26 and DKB offer English interfaces and are popular with expats
- You need your Meldebescheinigung to open most accounts
- Compare ATM networks and fees
