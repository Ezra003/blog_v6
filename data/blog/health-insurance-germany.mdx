## Overview of the German Health Insurance System

Germany has a dual system: statutory (public, GKV) and private (PKV) health insurance. Health insurance is mandatory for everyone living in Germany.

## Who Needs Public (GKV) vs. Private (PKV)?

- **GKV:** Required for most employees earning below ~€69,300/year (2025), students, pensioners, and job-seekers.
- **PKV:** Available to high earners, the self-employed, and civil servants. Not always the best choice for expats.

## How to Sign Up

1. Choose a provider (AOK, TK, Barmer, etc. for GKV; many options for PKV)
2. Submit your application (online or in person)
3. Provide proof of income, address, and ID
4. Receive your insurance card

## What’s Covered?

- Doctor visits, hospital care, prescriptions, basic dental
- Some extras (e.g., glasses) may not be fully covered

## Tips for Expats

- GKV is usually safer and easier to manage for newcomers
- PKV can be cheaper for young/single people, but costs rise with age
- You need proof of insurance to get a residence permit
