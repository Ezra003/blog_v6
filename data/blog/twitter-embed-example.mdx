## More about Twitter Embeds

You can use Twitter embeds to share interesting discussions, showcase testimonials, or highlight news directly in your blog posts. Embedding tweets is a great way to make your content more interactive and engaging for readers.

### Why Embed Tweets?

- **Social Proof:** Show what people are saying about your work or topics you care about.
- **Live Updates:** Share breaking news or trending topics with real-time content from Twitter.
- **Community Engagement:** Highlight conversations and connect with your audience.

### How To Customize

You can customize the embedded tweet by changing the `tweetId` in the frontmatter above. For example, try embedding tweets from your own account, or from other public accounts that are relevant to your post.
